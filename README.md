# Rule-Based-Programming--Syllogism-Solver
Problem solver: accept the statement of a syllogism given in natural language and solve it if able. 
For the actual solver you have to use a rule-based language. You can implement an UI, a validator and other components you think are necessary in any programming language. 
Some examples of similar functionality:

Your software has to accept as input a text in natural language. You can validate the input however you want (check if there are three clauses, check if each has two Noun Phrases and one predicate, check if particular Noun Phrases are common in more clauses, others.)
